More and more companies are including design into their processes. There is some kind of fancy job title or job description with design in it. This description varies from company to company. But what is design really? 

### What is design really?

Defining design is not easy. The common, every day use aims to the appearance of things. Pejoratively the word design gets used to describe things that are not useful or useable. 

But also the professional field has no general definition for the term design. Design is a method to combine form and function. It provides the possibility to imagine things that do not exist yet and let this thought become reality. Every artificial thing is designed, but this design is just the appearance of a complex system. Design is subject to certain conditions within these it has to achieve a goal that is more than the sum of its parts. Design should connect user and creator and make the product self explanatory. People design to survive, to evolve, to create something lasting und to support other people. Motivation to do so is the pure necessity but also the search for control, order and meaning.

Design is a process. How this project looks varies. There is a very good overview of various design process in [Hugh Dubberly's "How do you design?"](http://www.dubberly.com/articles/how-do-you-design.html){:target="_blank"}.
