Most people thought about it at least one time. Packing up your stuff and just leave. Be free and be where ever you want to be. Just enjoying your life.

This adventure could be to travel around the world, to take a sabbatical, to emigrate or to become a digital nomad. There are a lot of possibilities out there, you just have to find the right one for you. 

But most of the time the dreaming gets stopped by everyday life. You start to second guess the possibility of it to work. Or you find reasons not to follow through. There are a lot of reasons not to do it, but most of them aren't any good. If you really want to do it - I came to realise - there is a way. 

My husband and I though about various possibilities for a while now. We always wanted to travel, to see the world, to escape everyday life. We don't wanted to have this kind of normal life where you work 9 to 5, come home, relax, sleep, go to work. Every day. Most of the time you are to tired at the end of the day or the weekends to do something other then what is necessary, like grocery shopping or cleaning up your apartment. And then it's Monday again.

Don't get me wrong. I love to work. In fact I work to much most of the time. But I work when and where I want to work. I don't work because someone tells me to sit in my office from 9 to 5 and tells me what to do. 

Step by step your initial thoughts became plans. And after reading a lot of blogposts and articles from people that actually have done it and live a great life like that, we run out of reasons not to do it. 

Our jobs only require a laptop and internet. Our apartment is really pretty but it was time for a change of scenery anyway. Of course it is sad to leave friends and family behind, but thanks to various apps the online communication is pretty easy these days. 

And so our plan became more and more detailed. We knew that we want to get to know the places we are going to life in, so we decided to stay at each place for several weeks. That's also essential for building a routine and being able to work effectively. Also we decided to quit our apartment and sell all our stuff. If we ever decide to have an apartment again, we can find one and start putting new stuff in. No old baggage that has to fit, because we stored it, several years ago. 

The next decision was to travel light. To be exact, to travel with Carry-On only. This way we don't need to check-in our luggage at the airport, our bags can't go missing and I can handle my bag pack without any help from a strong bystander.

And so we bought the backpacks, sold our stuff, said goodbye to everyone and off we were to Thailand. Yes, in the plain we wondered a little bit, where we found the courage to take this step, but we are very excited about the future and what will come...
