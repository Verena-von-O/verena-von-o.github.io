When you are a Designer, Graphic Designer, Artist or something like that you have to think about the difference between art or design at some point or another.

Of course there is the everyday use for both concepts. Artist are freethinkers which create art offside every rule. This art is most of the time not understood by so called "normal" people. "That's art" has some times a negative meaning and is designated to things that looks different, unfamiliar or wrong. 

The word "design" is often used as a description for thinks that are not useful, not usable and most of the time look kind of clean and white.

But besides the everyday use of these two words there are some more accurate differences the distinguish between Art and Design. 

### What is Design? What is Art?

In general the difference is pretty easy. The famous statement “form follows function” is a good way to start.

Design creates things which perform a specific function. Every other aspect has to be subordinate. Design combines form and function to become the most useful thing possible. With the goal to fulfil a specific function, Design is objectively assessable. For example a chair has the function that a person can sit on it. If it is not possible to sit on a chair or is it just very uncomfortable, it is bad designed. But if the chair is comfortable it is good design. How the chair look, which material it is made of or if there are any ornamentation is secondary.

However Art does not have to fulfil any function. Art is there to be there. Nothing more, nothing less. This way art is very subjective and not objectively assessable. It also does not matter if art is useful or understandable. Art can give the observer a certain feeling. This feeling varies from person to person. This way one Artwork can make one person very happy and deeply upset another person.

### But is there design without art?

There are clear differences between art and design. But both fields do not stand alone. Design often uses artistic elements. Not every decision that is made while designing a product is out of pure functionality. There also is a bit focus on aesthetics. And as long as these aesthetics do not impair the usability of the product it is possible to create a aesthetic and somehow artistic product which does not only is usable but also nice to look at.
