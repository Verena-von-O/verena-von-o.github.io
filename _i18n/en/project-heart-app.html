  <h2 class="headline">Heart Rate App</h2>
    <p>Where there is a problem, there should be an app.</p>

<div class="project-sub-content">
      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
    <p>With devices like the Apple Watch you can measure your heart rate pretty easily. All you need is a watch and a heart rate and off you go. But as soon as you want more than your current heart rate or a list with the raw data points, the health app provided by Apple can’t help you anymore. But I wanted more. Good thing I married an iOS developer.</p>

    <h3>The Goals</h3>
    <p>At the end I wanted an app that shows me the last measured heart rate and gives me a daily, weekly and monthly overview. The app should allow me to comment on each measurement to see the correlation between my heart rate and my activity, e.g. working out, relaxing, arguing with someone or petting a dog.

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <p>There aren't a lot of apps out there that provide what I was looking for. Therefore the research part for this project was slim. And because we already knew what we wanted in the app, we were able to start with the framework right away.</p>

    <h3>The Framework</h3>
    <p>The idea was to build an app that contains everything necessary but nothing more. Easy and simple. So we reduced everything to our main goals: See last measurement, monthly, weekly and daily overview and being able to comment.

    <h3>The Mockups</h3>
    <p>For the Mockups we stayed within our “easy and simple” credo. We eliminated everything unnecessary and made everything else visible, discoverable and understandable. No need for explanations to understand what you have to do to use the app. Sounds easy and desirable but is actually hard work. You have to think a lot about each thing you put on the screen and ask yourself, if it is necessary or if there is an easier way.

    <h3>The Colours</h3>
    <p>After everything has its place and purpose you can start making it pretty. In my opinion, the looks are as important as the functions for a product to succeed. Without the necessary functions you can’t use the product properly, but without it looking appealing, you don’t want to use it. Both parts can be a big problem. So why not make it pretty? We started with a nice color palette. I think it is important to reduce your palette to 5 colors or less. This way you can alternate and differentiate without looking like you took too many pills while working on the colors. Decide on one basic color for the background and built on that.

    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
    <p>Besides the iPhone App we decided on building an Apple Watch App. This way you can comment on a measurement right away. Just tap on the icons or dictate your current activity.</p>
    <h4>iPhone App</h4>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>
    <!-- <div class="box-subproject-img">

      <h4>Apple Watch App</h4>
      <p>Coming soon...</p>
      <!-- <div class="box-subproject-img">
        <img src="/img/heartrate-icon.png" alt="">
    </div> -->

  <h3>What's next?</h3>
  <p>While working on a project, you always have ideas what else would be nice to have. Our first version of the app is the simplest way. Basic features that make it easy to use and understand. Next up, there are possibilities like being able to export your recorded data.
  Or you can comment on your measurements with customised icons instead of text. <br>
  We are excited to see what will come.
