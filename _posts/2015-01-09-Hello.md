Just saying hi and welcome to my site. I am excited to learn how to code, how to make my code better and to share my experiences with you.

I hope you enjoy reading about my progress and how I get there. I will write about courses I take, articles I read and other thinks I come across. If you have any questions or just want to talk, you can reach me via [mail](mailto:verena.ortlieb@gmail.com).
