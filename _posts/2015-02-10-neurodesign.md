Neurodesign is integrating neurological findings into your design.

I first red about Neurodesign in ["Reptil-Hirn surft mit"](http://www.decode-online.de/downloads/pdf/Weave_Reptil_Hirn_Surft_mit_Christian_Scheier.pdf). This german article explains how much digital products can gain from concepts and designs that mind the users subliminal perception.

Real insights in the how and why of Neurodesign gives the book [Neuro Web Design](http://example.com/) by Susan Weinschenk. She explains how the brain works, why people react and act the way they do and how to integrate this insights into a product to make a better User Experience.
