Neurodesign is integrating neurological findings into your design. This way, your design becomes more intuitive and therefore easier and better to use.  

I first read about Neurodesign in ["Reptil-Hirn surft mit"](http://www.decode-online.de/downloads/pdf/Weave_Reptil_Hirn_Surft_mit_Christian_Scheier.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}. This german article explains how much digital products can gain from concepts and designs that mind the users subliminal perception.

Real insights in the how and why of Neurodesign gives the book [Neuro Web Design](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0321603605/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0321603605&linkCode=as2&tag=vereortl-21){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} by Susan Weinschenk. She explains how the brain works, why people act and react the way they do and how to integrate this insights into a product to improve the User Experience.

I love the idea to make products better by understanding the userâ€™s brain. I studied this topic for my final thesis. Therefore, I started to read a lot of books and studies. Some of the books you can find in my [reading list](/ux-reading-list).
