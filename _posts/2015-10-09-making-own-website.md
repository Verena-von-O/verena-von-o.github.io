If you want to create a portfolio as UX Designer (or any other Designer) you have different possibilities. I decided to show my projects on my own website. Therefore I had to learn how to code.

My biggest asset to this plan was my [super-nerd husband](https://www.florianbuerger.com). Having a Developer to your dispose 24/7 really helps the process. But as a independent and sometimes stubborn woman, I wanted to do as much as possible on my own.

First step was to take some online courses. I love the lessons from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com). I started with  "HTML&CSS"  and after that I took the "Make a Website" course. The lessons are short and easy and very well explained. After these lessons I felt really well prepared to start coding.

Next up was a lot of trying, deleting, changing, swearing and rejoicing. After I understood the basics of how to do it, I had to decide on the optics and the content.

Starting with a framework, I first put everything in a thought would be nice to have on a website. Then I started to rearrange and made some cuts and additions until I was ok with it.

The optics were the most difficult part for me. There are just so much possibilities. So I had to change my design every other day because I had a better idea. But once I found my style, I just new that the search was over.

After that its all about filling your pretty pages with content. Easy said, some days really hard to achieve. But I hope you like what you find on my very own website.
