If you want to create a portfolio as UX Designer (or any other Designer) you have different possibilities. I decided to show my projects on my own website. Therefore I had to learn how to code.

My biggest asset to this plan was my super-nerd husband. Having a Developer to your dispose 24/7 really helped the process. But as a independent and sometimes stubborn woman I wanted to do as much as possible on my own.

First step was to search for online lessons. I love the lessons from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com). I started with  "HTML&CSS"  and after that I took the "Make a Website" course. The lessons are short and easy and very well explained. After these lessons I felt really well prepared to start coding.
