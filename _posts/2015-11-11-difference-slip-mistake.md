An error is.... But there are different kinds of errors

In his book [The Design of Everyday Things](http://example.com/), Don Norman explains the classification of human error he developed with the british psychologist James Reason.
First they divided human error into **slips** and **mistakes**.

When a person intends to to something and ends up doing something else it is called a **slip**. But if a person establishes a wrong goal or forms a wrong plan it is called a **mistake**.
