In general, an error is an action which is incorrect or inaccurate. But there are different kinds of errors.

In his book [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0465050654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0465050654&linkCode=as2&tag=vereortl-21){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, Don Norman explains the classification of human error he developed with the British psychologist James Reason.
They divided human error into **slips** and **mistakes**.

When a person intends to to something and ends up doing something else it is called a **slip**. But if a person establishes a wrong goal or forms a wrong plan it is called a **mistake**.
