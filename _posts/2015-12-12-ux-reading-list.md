Every designer, developer and person who is interested these topics should read books. A lot of books to be correct. Here you can find a list of books I red, want to read and read again from time to time.

Of course the list is not complete but in my opinion a good start to get familiar with topics like Usability, User Experience, Research, Human Computer Interaction and so on.
