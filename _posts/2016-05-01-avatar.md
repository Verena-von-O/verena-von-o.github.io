An avatar is ...

It can be used to...

I created my first avatar for a project I was part of in 2015/16. The project was a ... and the avatar should be used to guide the teenagers through the game.

First and most imported was to find out how the avatar should look. I used [avataro](http://www.avataro.de) to create some quick models. On this basis the project team was able to discuss different ideas. Most difficult part was to find a character which would be accepted by the users but also matches the clients expectations (big difference here).

After the first discussions I started creating our own avatar. We decided on a woman around the age of 20. She should look "fun", "modern", "young", "hip" and some other buzzwords.

Most important lesson I learned was, that no one really knows the wright answer. As long as you can argue for your solution and everyone feels like there ideas were respected, everybody is happy.
