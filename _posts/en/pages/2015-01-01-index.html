<h2 class="headline-index">Hey there, <br> I am Verena.</h2>

<p>I am an Icon Designer and Illustrator and a digital nomad travelling the world. Besides showing some of my work this website is my first coding project. Hope you like it as much as I do.</p>


<h3 class="subheadline-index">Some Say its Art</h3>

<p>I make a lot of Icons, Illustations and other things. Some of them you can find on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verena_von_o/" target="_blank">Instagram account</a> or on <a href="https://dribbble.com/verena_von_o" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>. Here are some of the newest:

<h3 class="subheadline-index">Moreover...</h3>
<p>In summer 2016, me and <a href="http://www.florianbuerger.com" target="_blank">my handsome husband</a> started our biggest adventure. After selling almost all our stuff we started to travel the world while working on projects for clients, but also on some ideas of our own. If you want to read more about our adventures, you can find <a href="https://www.immerguteswetter.de" target="_blank">our blog here</a> and see some pictures <a href="https://www.instagram.com/immerguteswetter/" target="_blank">here on Instagram</a>.</p>
