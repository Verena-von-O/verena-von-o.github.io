<h2 class="headline-index">Hey there, <br> I am Verena.</h2>

<p>I am an UX/UI & Icon Designer and Illustrator travelling the world. Currently I am working as a freelancer for various clients on a wide range of projects. I love new challenges.<br>
Besides showing some of my work this website is my first coding project. Hope you like it as much as I do.

<p>For my projects but also just for fun I like to draw, sketch and paint. Some of the outcome you can find <a href="/projects">here</a> or on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verena_von_o/" target="_blank">instagram account</a>.
</p>

<p>Starting in summer 2016, me and <a href="http://www.florianbuerger.com" target="_blank">my handsome husband</a> are going to start our next adventure. After selling almost all our stuff we start to travel the world while working on projects for clients, but also on some ideas of our own. If you want to read more about our adventures, you can find <a href="https://www.immerguteswetter.de" target="_blank">our blog here</a> and see some pictures <a href="https://www.instagram.com/immerguteswetter/" target="_blank">here on Instagram</a>.</p>
