Every designer and developer and person should read books. A lot of books to be correct. Here you can find a list of books I read, want to read and re-read from time to time.

Of course this list is not complete but in my opinion a good start to get familiar with topics like Usability, User Experience, Research, Human Computer Interaction and so forth.
