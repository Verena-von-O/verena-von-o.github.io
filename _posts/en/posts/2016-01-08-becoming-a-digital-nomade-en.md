Most people thought about it at least one time. Packing up your stuff and just leave. Be free and be where ever you want to be. Just enjoying your life.

This adventure could be a to travel around the world, to take a sabbatical, to emigrate or to become a digital nomad. There are a lot of possibilities out there, you just have to find the right one for you. 

But most of the time the dreaming gets stoped by everyday life. You start to second guess the possibility of it to work. Or you find reasons to not follow through, maybe your job is located here or stuff like that. There are a lot of reasons not to do it, but most of them aren't any good. If you really want to do it, I came to realize, there is a way. 

My husband and I though about various possibilities for a while now. We always wanted to travel, to see the world, to escape everyday life. We don't wanted to have this kind of normal life where you work 9 to 5, come home, relax, sleep, go to work. Every day. Most of the time you are to tired at the evenings or the weekends to do something other then what is necerassy, like groccerie shopping or cleaning up your appartment. And then it's monday again.

Don't get me wrong. I love to work. In fact I work to much most of the time. But I work when and where I want to work. I don't work because someone tells me to sit in my office from 9 to 5 and tells me what to do. 

Step by step your initial thoughts became plans. And after reading a lot of blogposts and aricles from people that acutally have done it and live a great life like that, we run out of reasons not to do it. 

Our jobs only require a laptop and internet. Our appartnemt is really pretty but it was time for a change of scenery anyway. Of course it is sad to leave your friends and family behind, but thanks to various apps the online communcation is pretty easy these days. 

After reading a lot about different posiibilities to realize our Vorhaben, our plan became more and more detailed. We knew that we want to get to know the places we are going to life in, so we decidet to stay at each place for several weeks. Thats also essencial for building a routine and being able to work effektively. Also we decidet to quit our appartment and sell all our stuff. This way we did not need to find some place to LAger our stuff. If we ever decide to have a appartment again, we can find one and start putting new stuff in it. No old baggage that has to fit, because we lagerten es ein, several years ago. 

The next decision was to travel light. To be exact, to travel with carry-on only. This way we don't need to AUFGEBEN GEPACK at the airport, our bags can't go missing and I can handle my bagpack without any help from a strong bystander.

And so we bought the backpacks, sold our stuff, said goodbye to everyone and off we were to Thailand. Yes, in the plain we wondered a little bit, where we found the courage to take this step, but we are very excited about the future and what will come...
