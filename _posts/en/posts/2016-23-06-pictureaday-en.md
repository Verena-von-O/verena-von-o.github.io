What would life be without challenges. And like there isn’t enough on my plate already, I thought of something new to start.

How often do you have a new idea for a project, no matter the size, but also have 300 other ideas half finished on your desk?! There is always something to modify, to revise, to perfect before the project can be published. This way, most projects never see the light of day. But why? Is there such a thing as “finished”? And if there is, how does it look like? How does it feel? And how long does it take to get there?

A few days ago, I listend to a [Podcast from Sean Wes](https://seanwes.com/podcast/){:target="_blank"}. He is extremely successful at what he does and he has a lot of interesting things to say. If you haven't heart of him yet, go check out his podcast. In episode 6, he and his co-host discussed when to release a project. And they also used the now famous sentence "*done is better than perfect*". Meaning not to wait until the project is absolutly perfect. Maybe there is no perfect. Maybe there will never be the so called perfect endstate. 

And only through new challenges, your skills can grow. And one skill to increase is to finish a project and put it out there. Moreover, a 90% done project which gets published get‘s a 100% more attention and recognition than a 95% done project which doesn‘t get published. Especially as the last few percent to come close to the unattainable 100% mark need more attention and work than the rest of the project. Besides, who else but the own critical self can spot the difference between 95% and 98%??

So, what do I do with these insights? With the motto “A picture a day” I am going to post one project every day on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/verena_von_o/){:target="_blank"}. I don‘t know what kind of projects may come, but that‘s part of the fun. My goal is to draw something every single day to improve my creativity and my skills. And of course to finish projects and publish them instead of working on them for week after week in order to reach perfection. 

I hope you will enjoy what will come. And maybe, just maybe, you also can start, and finish, some of your projects with. Because: *"done is better than perfect"*.
