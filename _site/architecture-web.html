        <p>As an architect you learn how to build different kinds of buildings. From garages to skyscrapers and everything in between. When you become a designer or developer for web or mobile, you learn how to code und design for the different devices. In both cases you should ask yourself what impact your decisions and designs can have.</p>

<p>I really like the article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Responsive Web Design</a> from Ethan Marcotte, who shows the difference between architecture and working on the web:</p>

<p>“A building’s foundation defines its footprint, which defines its frame, which shapes the facade. Each phase of the architectural process is more immutable, more unchanging than the last. Creative decisions quite literally shape a physical space, defining the way in which people move through its confines for decades or even centuries.</p>

<p>Working on the web, however, is a wholly different matter. Our work is defined by its transience, often refined or replaced within a year or two. Inconsistent window widths, screen resolutions, user preferences, and our users’ installed fonts are but a few of the intangibles we negotiate when we publish our work, and over the years, we’ve become incredibly adept at doing so.” (Ethan Marcotte in <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Responsive Web Design</a>).</p>
