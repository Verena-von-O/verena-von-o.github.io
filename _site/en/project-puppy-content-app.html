  <h2 class="headline">Puppy Content App</h2>
    <p>Puppies make humans happy. So why not provide puppy content in an easy and nice way.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-sub-content">
      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
    <p>Seeing a puppy makes most people smile. So why not watch some pictures of puppies to improve your mood? To do so, you can start to google for some pictures or follow different puppy-picture-posting accounts on Twitter, Instagram or others social media. But you could also have an app that provides you with the newest and cutest puppy pictures out there. Just open the app and be delighted.
</p>
    <!-- <div class="box-subproject-img">
      <img src="/img/done-icon.png" alt="">
  </div> -->

    <h3>The Goals</h3>
    <p>Just tap on the icon and start looking at cute puppies. Easy task for an easy app.
    </p>
    <!-- <div class="box-subproject-img">
      <img src="/img/done-icon.png" alt="">
    </div> -->

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <p>First step was to find sources that contain a lot of new pictures every day. Not just any pictures but the cutest that are out there. And yes, this step was a lot of fun. People really like taking pictures of their pets and post them online. They aren't always cute, but this is a discussion for another time.
    </p>

    <h3>The Framework</h3>
    <p>Because this version of the app has no settings the user can change, there is no need for more than one screen. Open the app, see a picture, swipe to get the next one.
    </p>
    <!-- <div class="box-subproject-img">
      <img src="/img/done-icon.png" alt="">
    </div> -->

    <h3>The Mockups</h3>
    <p>I admit, there was not really a need to make Mockups. But look at these cute pictures and tell me you wouldnâ€™t have made some of these yourselfâ€¦</p>
    <div class="box-subproject-img">
      <img src="/img/puppy-content-mockups.png" alt="Puppy Mockups">
    </div>

    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
    <p>Lots and lots of cuteness on your iPhone.</p>
    <h4>iPhone App</h4>
    <div class="box-subproject-img">
      <img src="/img/puppy-content-outcome.png" alt="Puppy iPhone App">
    </div>

    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    <p>While researching we agreed, that a later version of the app could give the user the possibility to choose between different categories. Maybe someone just wants to see cats. Another wants to be amazed by dogs. Therefore we would have to add a possibility for the user to change the settings to decide what to see. <br>
    We will see what cuteness comes next.
