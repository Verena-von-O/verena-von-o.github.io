        <p>If you want to create a portfolio as UX Designer (or any other Designer) you have different possibilities. I decided to show my projects on my own website. Therefore I had to learn how to code.</p>

<p>My biggest asset to this plan was my <a href="http://www.florianbuerger.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">super-nerd husband</a>. Having a Developer at your dispose 24/7 really helps in the process. But as an independent and sometimes stubborn woman, I wanted to do as much as possible on my own.</p>

<p>First step was to take some online courses. I love the lessons from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Codeacademy</a>. I started with  “HTML&amp;CSS”  and after that I took the “Make a Website” course. The lessons are short, easy and very well explained. After these lessons I felt really well prepared to start coding.</p>

<p>Next up was a lot of trying, deleting, changing, swearing and cheering. After I understood the basics of how to do it, I had to decide on the visuals and the content.</p>

<p>First I collected everything I thought might be nice to have on my website. Something about me, of course, but also my work, my thoughts, my ideas, and maybe some of my art. Next step was to build a framework. I put everything in, then I started to rearrange and made some cuts and additions until I was satisfied with it.</p>

<p>The visual design was the most difficult part for me. There are just so much possibilities and nice ways to make your website pretty. So I had to change my design every other day because I had a better idea. But once I found my style, I just new that the search was over.</p>

<p>After that its all about filling your pretty pages with content. Easier said than done, on some days it was really hard to achieve. But I hope you like what you find on my very own website.</p>
