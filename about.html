		<h2 class="headline">Hello, my name is Verena</h2>
		<p>Currently I am based in Stuttgart, Germany, but love to travel the world. This summer, me and my husband are ....
			I have a Bachelor of Arts in Business Psychology and a Master of Arts in Architecture.
			Architecture gave me a great design education. But I wanted more; I wanted to understand why people behave like they do and how products could be improved to match their users needs.
			I decided to study Business Psychology with a main focus on marketing and advertising psychology.
			While getting my degree I worked in different companies to gain insights in diverse fields of work.
			This helped me to improve not only the theoretical skills of my study but my personal skills like patience and stress resistance as well.
			Psychology and design in combination with a never ending will to improve myself have made me a competent and passionate UX Designer. </p>
