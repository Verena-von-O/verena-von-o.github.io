		<h2 class="headline">Hello, my name is Verena.</h2>

		<p>I am a UX Designer, UI Designer, problemsolver, idea creator, feedback encoder and much, much more nice job titles and Buzzwords. Why the variety? Because I have studied a lot and worked in  lot of different fields and am able to put these experiences to use. <br>
		I have a Bachelor of Arts in Business Psychology and a Master of Arts in Architecture.
		Architecture gave me a great design education. But I wanted more; I wanted to understand why people behave like they do and how products could be improved to match their users needs. So I decided to study Business Psychology with a main focus on marketing and advertising psychology.<br>
		Psychology and design in combination with a never ending will to improve myself have made me a competent and passionate working bee.

		<p>Currently I am based in Stuttgart, Germany, but love to travel the world. Starting summer 2016, me and <a href="http://www.florianbuerger.com">my husband</a> are going to start our next adventure. After selling almost all our stuff we start to travel the world while working on projects for different clients but also on some ideas of our own.</p>
