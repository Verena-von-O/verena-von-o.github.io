<p>Currently, I live in Stuttgart, Germany, but love to travel the world. Starting summer 2016, me and <a href="http://www.florianbuerger.com" target="_blank">my handsome husband</a> are going to start our next adventure. After selling almost all our stuff we start to travel the world while working on projects for clients, but also on some ideas of our own.</p>
