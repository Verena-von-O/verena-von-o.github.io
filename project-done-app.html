  <h2 class="headline">Done! App</h2>
    <p>I love making lists. What to do, when to do it and so on. And your phone can be a big help figuring out what to do next. But it can also stress you out.</p>

      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
    <p>Instead of using pen & paper you can make lists and reminders in your phone. That way you have them with you all the time. You can even use special apps which promise to help you reach your goals. That’s pretty nice if you want to be reminded to work out every day or call you mom at least once a week. There are even some apps that don’t just remind you at a given period but also allow you to enter goals, like “I want to make sport 5 times a week” or “I want to clean my apartment once a week”. Every achievement is recorded and presented to you in your log. Most of these “goal-achieving/habit building” apps show your current “streak” — your consecutive completion without missing a day in your new habit. The longer your current streak is going on, the more anxious you get to miss a day. You get motivated to keep the momentum going. This approach works if you reach your goal every time. But once you missed it, you feel bad. For some people, feeling bad for themselves motivates them. For a lot of people, including myself it makes you lose perspective. If I have made sport everyday for 23 days and then missed one day it is still a great accomplishment. But the app tells you that you suck because you failed to continue your streak.

    <h3>The Goals</h3>
    <p>Our goal was to create an app that lets you keep track of your accomplishments without assessing them. You open the app when you’ve completed something, you tell the app what you have done and you feel good about it. You see statistics how often you have done that particular task in the last week or month or any other definable period of time. This way you can keep track about what you have done without letting the app pressure you or feel bad about missing some days. You should feel positive about the things you did rather than feeling bad about the things you didn’t do.

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <p>TTo start of this project we had to research and evaluate a lot of existing apps. Apps for habit building, goal defining apps, to do apps and so on. This took a while because for a useful assessment you need to use the app for a while. Building on our assessments, we decided on features for our app and how to connect them.

    <h4>The Framework</h4>
    <p>The frameworks show, how the different parts of the app work together. Being able to use the app without introductions and understanding what to do without explanations was one big goal. Therefore we created an easy framework as well as simple signifiers.

    <h4>The Mockups</h4>
    <p>Plain screens and simple signifiers for an easy app.</p>

    <h4>The Colors</h4>
    <p>Like in all our projects we used a small color palette. </p>
