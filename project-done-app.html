  <h2 class="headline">Done! App</h2>

    <p>I love making lists. What to do, when to do it and so on. Your phone can be a big help figuring out what to do next. But it can also stress you out.</p>

<div class="project-sub-content">
      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
    <p>Instead of using pen & paper you can create lists and reminders on your phone. This way you have them with you all the time. You can use special apps which promise to help you reach your goals. That’s pretty neat if you want to be reminded to work out every day or call you mom once a week. There are even some apps that don’t just remind you at a given period but also allow you to enter goals, like “I want to work out 5 times a week” or “I want to clean my apartment once a week”. Every achievement is then recorded and presented to you in your log.</p>

    <p>Most of these “goal-achieving/habit building” apps show your current “streak”—your consecutive completions without missing a day in your new habit. The longer your current streak is going on, the more anxious you get to miss a day. You get motivated to keep the momentum going.</p>

      <p>This approach works if you reach your goal every single time. But once you missed it, you feel bad. For some people, feeling bad for themselves motivates them. For a lot of people, including myself, it makes you lose perspective. If I have worked out every day for 23 days in a row and then missed one day it is still a great accomplishment. But the app tells me  that I suck because I failed to continue my streak.</p>

    <h3>The Goals</h3>
    <p>Our goal was to create an app that lets you keep track of your accomplishments. You open the app when you’ve completed something. You tell the app what you have done and you feel good about it. You see statistics how often you have done that particular task in the last week or month or any other definable period of time. This way you can keep track of what you have done without letting the app pressure you or feel bad about missing some days. You should feel positive about the things you did rather than feeling bad about the things you didn’t do.</p>

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <p>To start this project we had to research and evaluate a lot of existing apps. Apps for habit building, apps for defining goals, to-do apps and so on. This took a while because, for a useful evaluation you need to use the app for more than a few minutes. Building on our assessments, we decided on features for our app and how to connect them.</p>

    <h3>The Framework</h3>
    <p>The framework shows how the different parts of the app work together. Being able to use the app without introductions and understanding what to do without explanations is a must. Therefore, we created an easy framework as well as simple signifiers.

    <h3>The Mockups</h3>
    <p>Plain screens and simple signifiers for an easy app.</p>

    <h3>The Colors</h3>
    <p>Like in all our projects we used a small color palette.</p>

    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
    <p>Besides a neat iPhone app, we build a Apple Watch App. This way you can add a new achievement without searching your phone first.</p>
