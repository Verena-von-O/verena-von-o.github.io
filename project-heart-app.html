  <h2 class="headline">Heart Rate App</h2>
    <p>Where there is a problem, there should be an app.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-sub-content">
      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
    <p>With devices like the apple watch you can measure your heart rate pretty easy. All you need is a watch and a heart rate and off you go.
But as soon as you want more than your current heart rate or a list with the raw data points, the health app provided by Apple can’t help you any more. I wanted a to be able to have a daily, weekly and monthly overview and be able to comment on every measurement. Good thing I married an iOS developer.

    <h3>The Goals</h3>
    <p>At the end I wanted an app that shows me the last measured heart rate, gives me a daily, weekly and monthly overview and lets me comment on each measurement, this way I can see what I have done, like sports, relaxing, arguing with someone, at the point of measurement.

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <p>First things first, we started with the framework.</p>
    <h4>The Framework</h4>
    <p>The idea was to build an app that contains everything necessary but nothing more. Easy and simple. So we reduced everything to our main goals: See last measurement, monthly, weekly and daily overview and being able to comment.

    </div> -->
    <h4>The Mockups</h4>
    <p>For the Mockups we stayed with our “easy and simple” credo. We eliminated everything unnecessary and made everything else visible, findable and understandable. No need for explanations to understand what you have to do to use the app. Sounds easy and desirable but is actually hard work.</p>

    </div> -->
    <h4>The Colors</h4>
    <p>After everything has its place and purpose you can start making it pretty. In my opinion the looks are as important as the function for a product to be good. Without the necessary functions you can’t use the product properly, but without it looking appealing, you don’t want to use it. Both parts can be a big problem. So why not make it pretty? We started with a nice color palette. I think it is important to reduce your palette to a maximum of 5 colors. This way you can alternate and differentiate but don’t start looking like you took too much drugs while working on the colors. Decide on one basic color for die background and built on that.</p>

    <h3>The Outcome</h3>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>
    <h4>iPhone App</h4>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>

      <h4>Apple Watch App</h4>
      <p>Coming soon...</p>

    </div> -->

  <h3>What's next?</h3>
  <p>While working on a project you always have ideas what else would be nice to have. Our first version of the app is the simplest way. Basic features which make it easy to use and understand the app. Next up there could be some more possibilities like being able to export your recorded data, change colors or our own icons to have a quick and fun way to comment on your measurements. We are excited to see what will come.
